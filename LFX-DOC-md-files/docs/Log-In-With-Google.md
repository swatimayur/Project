# Log In With Google
A _social login_ is single sign-on for end users. You can use your existing login credentials from Google (social network provider) to log in to CommunityBridge rather than creating a CommunityBridge account. During your initial login, you enter your Google credentials to authenticate your Google account. Subsequent logins do not require you to enter your credentials‚è§you simply click **Login with Google**. This one-click approach simplifies your logins.
